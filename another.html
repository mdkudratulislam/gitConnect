        <p>Black Hat Hackers: These types of hackers, often known as crackers and always have a malicious motive and
            gain
            illegal
            access to computer networks and websites. Their goal is to make money by stealing secret organizational
            data,
            stealing
            funds from online bank accounts, violating privacy rights to benefit criminal organizations, and so on. In
            today’s
            world, the majority of hackers fall into this category and conduct their business in a murky manner. Black
            hat
            hackers
            are nefarious individuals who aim to utilize their technical expertise to exploit and harm others. They
            usually
            have the
            expertise and training to get into computer networks without the consent of the owners, attack security
            holes,
            and
            circumvent security procedures. With the malevolent goal of gaining unauthorized access to networks and
            systems,
            they
            attack to steal data, spread malware causing damage to systems.</p>

        <p>White Hat Hackers/Ethical Hackers: White hat hackers (sometimes referred to as ethical hackers) are the polar
            opposites
            of black hat hackers. They employ their technical expertise to defend the planet against malicious hackers.
            White hats
            are employed by businesses and government agencies as data security analysts, researchers, security
            specialists,
            etc.
            White hat hackers, with the permission of the system owner and with good motives, use the same hacking
            tactics
            that the
            black hackers use. They can work as contractors, freelancers, or in-house for the companies. They assist
            their
            customers
            in resolving security flaws before they are exploited by criminal hackers.</p>

        <p>Gray Hat Hackers: They fall somewhere between the above-mentioned types of hackers, in that they gain illegal
            access to
            a system but do so without any malicious intent. The goal is to expose the system’s weaknesses. Instead of
            exploiting
            vulnerabilities for unlawful gains, grey hat hackers may offer to repair vulnerabilities they’ve identified
            through
            their own unauthorized actions. Example: They may, for example, infiltrate your website, application without
            your
            permission to seek vulnerabilities. They rarely, if ever, try to harm others. Grey hats do this to obtain
            notoriety and
            reputation in the cyber security industry, which helps them further their careers as security experts in the
            long run.
            This move, on the other hand, harms the reputation of the organizations whose security flaws or exploits are
            made
            public.</p>
